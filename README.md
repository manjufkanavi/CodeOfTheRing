⚔️ The Repository of the One Code to Practice Them All ⚔️
Welcome, Fellow Developer!
This is not the fabled repository of mythical projects or groundbreaking software. No, no. What you have stumbled upon is my humble code practice lair — a repository where ideas are forged, mistakes are made, and lessons are learned.

🧙‍♂️ What is this?
This repository exists solely for my personal experimentation, practice, and the occasional battle with bugs. Think of it as the "Bag End" of code — quiet, out of the way, but full of surprises for those who dare venture inside.

💻 What's in here?
Random snippets, trial runs, and POCs (Proof of Concepts) crafted with the care of a Dwarven smith.
Test-driven quests in various languages and frameworks, because one does not simply code without tests.
Unfinished projects, the "Mines of Moria" of this repo, awaiting their time to shine (or forever remain in shadow).
👁️ What NOT to Expect
Any semblance of production-ready code. This is my practice ground, not the White City of Minas Tirith.
Organized and pristine files. Orcs might have better folder structures than you'll find here.
World-changing applications. Sometimes, you just need to write a function that calculates the distance to Mordor.
🛠️ Why Practice?
Because even Gandalf didn’t start as Gandalf the White. So, I’m here to hone my skills, and this is the playground where I experiment. To learn the ways of the code is to become one with the fellowship of developers.

⚠️ Disclaimer: The code within may be incomplete, chaotic, or outright cursed. But that's all part of the journey to mastery.

Feel free to browse around, but remember: Not all code that wanders is lost!
